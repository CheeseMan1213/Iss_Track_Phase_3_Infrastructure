# Iss_Track_Phase_3_Infrastructure
This is my phase 3 for my IssueTrackingApp. This is the second infrastructure repo. I am doing this because I am making major infrastructure changes. Namely:

DynamoDB instead of RDS with Postgres.
API Gateway instead of Spring-boot REST.
AWS Lambda to be what gets kicked off and retrieves data from the database instead of the Java code.
Host frontend in S3
